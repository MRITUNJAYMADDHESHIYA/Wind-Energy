Project Overview: Conducted an aerodynamics and structural analysis of a wind turbine. Developed a linearized aerodynamics model to calculate the maximum bending stress on the turbine tower due to wind load.
Implemented a Python-based simulation to assess wind effects on turbine structure.
Analyzed the bending stress in the tower and compared it with the yield strength of the steel material, applying a safety factor.
Assumed a simplified linear elastic behavior of the material while acknowledging the need for more complex analysis to account for fatigue, non-linear behavior, and dynamic effects.
